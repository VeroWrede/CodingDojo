                    <p>We had birds,
                            gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
                            This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal,
                            entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In
                            speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a
                            little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to
                            the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as
                            witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this
                            point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason
                            than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
                            Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet
                            and playmate</p>

                    <p>One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one
                            of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my
                            presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he
                            inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The
                            fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no
                            longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight
                            from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, ginnurtured,
                            thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my
                            waistcoat-pocket a penknife, opened it, grasped the poor
                            beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from
                            the socket!</p>

                            spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and
                            solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had
                            seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had
                            consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the monster up
                            within the tomb. </p>
