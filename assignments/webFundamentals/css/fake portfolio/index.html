                    <p>We had birds,
                            gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
                            This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal,
                            entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In
                            speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a
                            little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to
                            the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as
                            witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this
                            point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason
                            than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
                            Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet
                            and playmate</p>

                    <p>One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one
                            of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my
                            presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he
                            inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The
                            fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no
                            longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight
                            from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, ginnurtured,
                            thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my
                            waistcoat-pocket a penknife, opened it, grasped the poor
                            beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from
                            the socket!</p>
