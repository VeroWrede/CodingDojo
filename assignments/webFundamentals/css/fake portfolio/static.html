                <p>We had birds,
                        gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
                        This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal,
                        entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In
                        speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a
                        little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to
                        the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as
                        witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this
                        point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason
                        than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
                        Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet
                        and playmate</p>
