I'm 25 years old and proud mother of a cat and a snake.

my hobbies are cooking, baking, dancing, and weight lifting.

things I like include but are not limited to music, animals and plants, math, sports, animes/mangas and architecture.

I moved to the Us with my parents after high school, went to college here for about 1.5/2 years studying mathematics, then went to Germany to resume my studies.
Instead of fisnishing my degree I dropped out, became ac hocolate maker and gor married.

Unfortunately, the chocolate company closed down and I was left unemployed.
That's when I decided to become a software engineer.

I've been teaching myslef how to code for a little over one year now, my main language is Python but I really want to add C# to my skill set.
Other technologies I like in particular are SQL and Git. 

right now I have a part time job as a TA for a data analysis and vizualization bootcamp, a part time job at a gym frent desk, and a part time job walking dogs.

My goal is a back end SE job, if possible remote. =)
